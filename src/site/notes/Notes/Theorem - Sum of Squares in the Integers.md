#theorem #number-theory 

#### Intuition
A prime integer is equal to the sum of two squares if and only if it is [[Notes/Integer Congruence\|congruent]] to $1$ mod $4$.

#### Formal Statement
For odd prime $p$,
$$
-1\equiv \square \bmod p \iff p =x^2 + y^2 \text{ in } \mathbb{Z}.
$$
Equivalently, we have,
$$
p\equiv 1 \bmod 4 \iff p = x^2 + y^2 \text{ in } \mathbb{Z}.
$$
