Primes in [[Notes/Quadratic Integers\|Quadratic Integers]] differ from primes in $\mathbb{Z}$.
#### In $\mathbb{Z}[i]$
Primes in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are numbers with prime norm or equal to primes in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Some primes in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with small norm
- $1+i, 1-i$ have norm $2$.
- $1+2i,1-2i$ have norm $5$.
- $2+3i,2-3i$ have norm 13.
- $3$
- $7$
- $11$
