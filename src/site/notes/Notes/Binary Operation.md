#### Definition
A binary operation on $X$ is a function $\sigma : X \times X \to X$. 

For all $x,y \in X$, we have $\sigma(x,y) \in X$. We can denote $\sigma(x,y)$ as $x \ast y$.

#### Examples 
1) Usual addition, subtraction, or multiplication on integers, rationals, or real numbers. 
2) $\cup, \cap , \setminus$ are all binary operations on the power set of a set.
