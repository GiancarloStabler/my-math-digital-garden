#### Definition
A normal subgroup $N\unlhd G$, is a subgroup $N\leq G$ such that $N$ is closed under [[Notes/Conjugate (Groups)\|conjugation]] by any element $g\in G$.

Additionally, a normal subgroup $N\unlhd G$ is a subgroup such that the cosets of $N$, $gN$ or $Ng$ for all $g\in G$, form a group.
